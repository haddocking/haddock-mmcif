# `haddock2mmcif`

ðŸš§ Attention ðŸš§

This code is under development and subject to change. Please report any bugs by opening an issue in the repository.

* * *

Encode information from a HADDOCK run to a `.cif` to be deposited in PDB-Dev.

## Currently the follow information is encoded in the `.cif`

- Models are represented as:

    1. Whole structure as rigid
    2. Interface as flexible, defined by the `flcut` parmameter in `run.cns`

- Clusters structures within `ModelGroup`, ranked by their top4 score
- Restraints as `Dataset` represented as `DerivedDistanceRestraint`

    1. Ambiguous, Active/Passive as `ResidueFeature` with probability defined by `ncvpart` in `run.cns` read from `ambig.tbl`
    2. Unambiguous, the `ResidueFeature` are read from `unambig.tbl`


## To-be-implemented

- HADDOCK-score
